Life Cycle of a Machine Learning (ML) Application
-------------------------------------------------

1. Problem Definition
Objective: Clearly define the problem to solve.
Key Activities:
- Understand the business need (e.g., reduce churn, predict sales).
- Identify the ML problem type: classification, regression, clustering, etc.
- Define success metrics (e.g., accuracy > 90%).

2. Data Collection
Objective: Gather relevant and sufficient data.
Key Activities:
- Identify data sources (databases, APIs, sensors, logs, etc.).
- Collect raw data with correct labeling (if supervised ML).
- Ensure data quality, privacy, and compliance (e.g., GDPR).

3. Data Preparation
Objective: Clean and preprocess data for modeling.
Key Activities:
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Perform feature engineering (new features, transformations).
- Split into training, validation, and test sets.

4. Model Selection
Objective: Choose suitable ML algorithm(s).
Key Activities:
- Select candidate models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Balance complexity vs interpretability (simple models vs black-box).
- Consider computational efficiency.

5. Model Training
Objective: Train models on prepared data.
Key Activities:
- Train with training dataset.
- Tune hyperparameters (Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization).
- Use cross-validation to ensure robustness.

6. Model Evaluation
Objective: Measure model performance on unseen data.
Key Activities:
- Test on validation and test sets.
- Use relevant metrics (accuracy, precision/recall, ROC-AUC, RMSE).
- Analyze errors and confusion matrix.
- Detect bias and fairness issues.

7. Model Optimization
Objective: Enhance model performance.
Key Activities:
- Fine-tune hyperparameters.
- Perform feature selection (remove redundant features).
- Use ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking).
- Consider model compression or pruning for deployment efficiency.

8. Model Deployment
Objective: Deploy the trained model into production.
Key Activities:
- Integrate into applications (via API, batch jobs, embedded systems).
- Ensure scalability, reliability, and security.
- Monitor real-time performance (drift detection, retraining triggers).
- Set up MLOps pipeline for CI/CD and automation.
