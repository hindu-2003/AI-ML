					Real Time Applications Developed by Using PYTHON
				========================================================
=>By Using PYTHON Programming with Other Supporting Technologies, We can develop the Following Real Time 
   Applications.

			1. Development of WEB Applications ( Web Sites)
					
					i) Java Programming Lang------->Tech: Servlets,JDBC,JSP,Hibernate,Spring,Spring Boot,..etc
						(SUN MS--->Oracle corp)
					ii) C#.net Programming Lang----->Tech: ASP.net, ASP Micro Services...etc
						(Micro Soft INC USA)
					iii) PYTHON Programming Lang--->Tech: Django,Falsk,Pyramid, Bottle
							(Less Lines of Code and Gives More Meaning bcoz of In-built MODULES)

			2. Development of Artificial Inteligence Applications
								a) Machine Learning
								b) Deep Learning
