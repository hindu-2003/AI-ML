Method
---------------
=> Name of Method can be any name .
=> Method will be executed if we call the method.
=> Per object, Method can be called any number of times.
=> Inside method we can write buisness logic.

Constructor

=> Constructor name should be always __init__ .
=> Constructor will be executed Automatically when we create the object
=> Per object, Method can be called only once .
=> Inside the constructor we have to declare and intailize Instance variables.
