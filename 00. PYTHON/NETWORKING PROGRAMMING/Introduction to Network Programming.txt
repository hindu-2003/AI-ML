						Introduction to Network Programming 
				==============================================
=>The purpose of Network Programming  is that "To Share the Data OR Information between Multiple Devices which 
     are  located either in Same Network OR in Different Network."
    ----------------------------------
=>Definition of Network:
    ----------------------------------
    A Network is  a Collection of Interconnected Autonomous Computers connected with Server.
=>To develop the Programs in  Networking, we have to write 2 Types of Programs. They are

				1. Server Side Program
				2. Client Side Program
--------------------------------------------------
1. Definition Server Side Program
--------------------------------------------------
=>A Server Side Program is one, which will recevive the Request from Client Side Program, Process the Client Side Program Request and Gives Response Back to Client Side Program.
-----------------------------------------------
2. Client Side Program
----------------------------------------------
A Client Side Program is one , which Makes Request to Server Side Program and Obtains Response from Server Side Program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Definition of DNS(Domain Naming Service)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A DNS is one of the Physical Machine, where the Server Side Program Resides.
=>The Default DNS of Every Computer is "localhost".
---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Definition of IP Address(Internet Protocol Address)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
=>An IP Address is one of the Numerical Address of  Physical Machine, where the Server Side Program Resides.
=>The Default IP Address of Every Computer is "127.0.0.1" (Loop Back Address)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Definition of Port Number
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Port Number is one of the Logical Numerical ID where Server Side Program Runs
