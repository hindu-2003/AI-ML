In the Windows Command Prompt, there are several commands related to changing the directory and modifying the path environment variable. Here are some of the key commands:

Change Directory (cd)
Change to a specific directory:



cd [path_to_directory]
Example:



cd C:\Users\Username\Documents
Change to the parent directory:



cd ..
Change to the root directory of the current drive:



cd \
Change to a directory on a different drive:


cd /d [drive_letter]:\[path_to_directory]
Example:


cd /d D:\Projects
Display the current directory:


cd
Modify Path Environment Variable
Display the current path:


echo %PATH%
Temporarily add a directory to the path (for the current session only):


set PATH=%PATH%;[path_to_directory]
Example:

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\MyApp\bin
Permanently add a directory to the path (requires administrative privileges):


setx PATH "%PATH%;[path_to_directory]"
Example:


setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\MyApp\bin"
Note: You need to restart the Command Prompt or log off and log back in to see the changes take effect.

Additional Notes
Paths with spaces need to be enclosed in quotes. Example:


cd "C:\Program Files\MyApp"
Use setx carefully because it changes the system or user environment variables permanently. Always make sure to include the existing %PATH% in the new path to avoid overwriting it completely.
