      "9. What’s the difference between a view and a materialized view? \n",
      "A view is simply an SQL query that is stored on the database, without the results. Every time a view is \n",
      "queried, this definition of the view’s query is run. If the underlying tables have been updated, the view \n",
      "will load these results. \n",
      "A materialized view is a query where the results have been stored in a permanent state, like a table. If \n",
      "the underlying tables are updated, then by default, the materialized views are not updated. \n",
      " \n",
      "10. What is a primary key? \n",
      "A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies a row in a table. It’s created on a \n",
      "table and ensures that the values in that column or columns must be unique and not NULL. \n",
      "This is often done using some kind of numeric ID field but doesn’t have to be. \n",
      "Related: ​A Guide to Database Keys \n",
      " \n",
      "11. What is a foreign key? \n",
      "A foreign key is a field in a table that refers to a primary key in another table. It is used to link the \n",
      "record in the first table to the record in the second table. \n",
      " \n",
      "12. What is a composite key? \n",
      "A composite key is a primary key that is made up of two or more fields. Often, primary keys are single \n",
      "fields, but in some cases, a row is identified by multiple fields. This is what a composite key is. \n",
      " \n",
      "13. What is a surrogate key? \n",
      "A surrogate key is a field in a table that has been created solely for the purpose of being the primary \n",
      "key. It has no other purpose than an internal storage and reference number. \n",
      "For example, a customer may have an account number that is unique to them, but a customer_id field \n",
      "might be created on the table and used as the primary key, in case business rules change and mean \n",
      "that the account number is no longer unique.  \n",
      " \n",
      "14. What is a unique constraint? How is it different from a primary key? \n",
      "A unique constraint is a constraint on a table that says that a column or set of columns needs to have \n",
      "unique values. \n",
      "It’s different to a primary key in that a table can only have one primary key, but a table can have zero, \n",

      "Basic SQL Interview Questions \n",
      "1. What is the difference between SQL, Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server? \n",
      "SQL is the name of the language used to query databases and follows a standard. Oracle, MySQL and \n",
      "SQL Server are different implementations or versions of a database management system, which \n",
      "implement the SQL standard and build on it in different ways. \n",
      "Oracle database is targeted at large companies, SQL Server is owned by Microsoft, and MySQL is \n",
      "owned by Oracle but targeted toward smaller companies and systems. \n",
      " \n",
      "2. What is the difference between SQL and PL/SQL? \n",
      "SQL is the language used to query databases. You run a query, such as SELECT or INSERT, and get a \n",
      "result. \n",
      "PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language/Structured Query Language. It’s Oracle’s procedural \n",
      "language and is built on top of SQL. It allows for more programming logic to be used along with SQL. \n",
      " \n",
      "3. What is the difference between SQL and T-SQL? \n",
      "SQL is the language used to query databases. You run a query, such as SELECT or INSERT, and get a \n",
      "result. \n",
      "T-SQL stands for Transact-SQL and is a language and set of extensions for SQL Server that allows for \n",
      "further programming logic to be used with SQL. \n",
      " \n",
      "4. What are the different DDL commands in SQL? Give a description of their \n",
      "purpose. \n",
      "● CREATE: creates objects in the database \n",
      "● ALTER: makes changes to objects in the database \n",
      "● DROP: removes objects from the database \n",
      "● TRUNCATE: deletes all data from a table \n",

      " \n",
      "5. What are the different DML commands in SQL? Give a description of their \n",
      "purpose. \n",
      "● SELECT: retrieve or view data from the database \n",
      "● INSERT: add new records into a table \n",
      "● UPDATE: change existing records in a table \n",
      "● DELETE: removes data from a table \n",
      "● MERGE: performs an UPSERT operation, also known as insert or update. \n",
      "● CALL: runs a PL/SQL procedure or Java program \n",
      "● EXPLAIN PLAN: explains the way the data is loaded \n",
      "● LOCK TABLE: helps control concurrency \n",
      "  \n",
      "6. What is the purpose of the BETWEEN keyword? \n",
      "The BETWEEN keyword allows you to check that a value falls in between two other values in the \n",
      "WHERE clause. \n",
      "It’s the same as checking if a value is greater than or equal to one value, and less than or equal to \n",
      "another value. \n",
      " \n",
      "7. What is the purpose of the IN keyword? \n",
      "The IN keyword allows you to check if a value matches one of a range of values. It’s often used with \n",
      "subqueries that return more than one row. \n",
      " \n",
      "8. What is a view? When would you use one? \n",
      "A view is a database object that allows you to run a saved query to view a set of data. You create a view \n",
      "by specifying a SELECT query to be used as the view, and then the view can be queried just like a table. \n",
      "There are several reasons to use a view, such as to improve to security, create a layer of abstraction \n",
      "between the underlying tables and applications, and to simplify queries. \n",

      "default? How can you eliminate duplicate rows from a query result? \n",
      "Yes, they will be displayed by default. To eliminate duplicate records, you use the DISTINCT keyword \n",
      "after the word SELECT. \n",

      "18. What are the different JOIN types and what do they do? \n",
      "The different join types in Oracle SQL are: \n",
      "● Inner join: Returns records that exist in both tables. \n",
      "● Left join/left outer join: Returns records that exist in the first table and shows NULL for those \n",
      "values that don’t exist in the second table. \n",
      "● Right join/right outer join: Returns records that exist in the second table and shows NULL for \n",
      "those values that don’t exist in the first table. \n",
      "● Full join/full outer join: Returns records that exist in both the first and second table, and shows \n",
      "NULL for those values that don’t exist in the corresponding table. \n",
      "● Cross join: Returns all combinations of all records in both tables. \n",
      "● Natural join: an inner join with two tables on columns that have the same names. \n",

      " \n",
      "19. What is a “cross join”? \n",
      "A cross join is a type of join where the results displayed contain the records from both tables in all \n",
      "possible combinations. There is no field used to perform the join. \n",
      "For example, if table A has 10 records and table B has 8 records, then the cross join will result in 80 (or \n",
      "10 x 8) records. \n",
      "The result can also be called a “cartesian product”. \n",
      " \n",
      "20. What is a self join and why would you use one? \n",
      "A self join is a type of join where a table is joined to itself. \n",
      "You would use a self join when a table has a field that refers to another record in the same table. It’s \n",
      "often used in hierarchical structures, such as employee tables having a manager_id column where the \n",
      "manager_id refers to another employee record. \n",

      "Aggregation and Grouping \n",
      "22. What is an aggregate function? \n",
      "An aggregate function is an SQL function that reads data from multiple rows and displays a single \n",
      "value. Some examples of aggregate functions are COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, and AVG. They are often \n",
      "used with a GROUP BY clause but can be used by themselves. \n",
      " \n",
      "23. Can you nest aggregate functions? \n",
      "Yes, you can have nested aggregate functions up to two levels deep. For example, you can use \n",
      "MAX(COUNT(*)). \n",
      " \n",
      "24. Does COUNT return the number of columns in a table? \n",
      "No, it returns the number of records in a table. \n",

      "26. What is the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses? \n",
      "The WHERE clause is run to remove data before grouping. The HAVING clause is run on data after it \n",

      "A temp table (or temporary table) is a database table that exists temporarily on the system. It allows \n",
